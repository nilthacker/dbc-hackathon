# Dev Bootcamp January 2016 Hackathon

Our pitch was to create a day planner for visitors to San Francisco. The user specifies the intensity (number of events) of their day, their price point (low, medium, high) and the category of events/sites to visit and the app plans out their entire day. We use the Google Places API to find places of interest, places to eat and (in conjunction with the Uber API) offer transit solutions between each event.
